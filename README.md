# My Portfolio: AI, Machine Learning, Data-Science
This repository contains: AI, Machine Learning and Data Science code that I have developed from theory around them I have personally studied and I will continue to add to this folder as my knowledge of these fields expand. This repository also contains the initial folders and files of my Final year Project: Modelling NBA Results with Machine Learning Algorithms: A Comparative Study.
